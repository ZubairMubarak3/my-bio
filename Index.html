            <p> <h3>Zubair attended a public school in Kandahar city, named Mahmood-e-Tarzi High School at age four, where he excelled academically and socially. He was a quiet and innocent but painstaking student who was staying late at night writing his long homework under his kind mother’s supervision. He made many friends and earned the respect of his teachers. 
After studying his fourth grade, he shifted to another relatively better public school named Zahir Shahi High School. But he had the opportunity to become a student of the International Turkish Schools, Kandahar Shah Huseyn Afghan-Turk High School from his 8th grade. This was a great opportunity to access a high quality school after passing its entry exam.  He finally, graduated from high school in 2016.
